I started my career developing hardware and embedded systems software at a high-energy physics lab where I had a cozy desk with a warm VME crate and worked with nice physicists. Then something Tookish woke up inside me and I joined a start up, did cryptography-related development, and was eventually eventually acquired by RSA Security. After that, I accidentally co-founded another small lifestyle company with a friend before I went down the rabbit hole (yes, I\u2019m mixing Carroll with Tolkien) and joined the legions of others developing for the web.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a dangerous business, being a developer. You step into the code, and if you don\u2019t keep your feet, there\u2019s no telling where you might be swept off to.<\/p>\n<p>When I\u2019m not wrangling code for one project or another, you might find me in the kitchen, cooking, baking bread, or brewing beer.

I served in the US AirForce for 6 years then worked for the Federal Bureau of Prisons for 10 years. I moved to Canada in 2007 and opened a photography studio, then closed it in 2015. I taught myself HTML 1 back in 1999. I started building most of my sites in HTML typed up on notepad until I found Macromedia Dreamweaver (I still have my Studio 8 backpack haha!).  I found WordPress in 2008 and had a touch and go with it until 2015 when I started working with it exclusively. I love helping people with tech and showing them how to get themselves an online presence and being safe and secure about it. I am always learning new stuff and am consumed by never ending knowledge available here.<\/p>\n",

I went to Temple University where I  received my BA in Communication in 2012. <\/p>\n<p>Fun fact, fellow a11n Anthony Bubbel was Matt Mullenweg\u2019s campus concierge while Matt was accepting an award from Temple\u2019s Fox School of Business. I was just a lowly freshman at the time! I had no clue what WordPress was or the significance of it all. Small world ????<\/p>\n<p>I spent the last three years bringing my family\u2019s catering company into the 21st century and got my first experience with WordPress through adjusting bits and pieces of our website. In June 2016 I joined the Philadelphia WordPress meet-up and by September had written and presented my first topic, How to Build One Page Themes Using WP-Query.<\/p>\n<p>I met Alx Block early on in the meet-up and he told me Automattic was hiring, I couldn\u2019t believe him, I thought he must\u2019ve been talking to someone behind me! By November I had begun co-organizing the meetup and by January I had presented again on Site Speed with WordPress. Alx asked me again to apply, but this time he made it clear he was serious. I took him up on the offer and by March had started my first trial at Automattic.<\/p>\n<p>After an exciting four weeks, I learned that this wasn\u2019t the right time to join our merry band. I reflected and renewed my resolve to trial again. After five months of self-designated learning and personal growth, I applied for my second trial. By October of 2017, I had accepted an offer to become a full-time Happiness engineer and have been grinning ever since. People must think I am a lunatic when they come across me walking down the street ????<\/p>\n<p>I love learning about site speed and theme development, and recently co-authored an image deferral plugin with a buddy of mine, feel free to use it (preferably not on a production site at the moment!): https:\/\/github.com\/alejandroxlopez\/pimgdefer<\/p>\n<p>If you need help troubleshooting theme bugs, image bugs, CSS bugs, I\u2019m your guy! Please don\u2019t hesitate to ping me, I often wake up at 3am and respond to pings, it is actually a rather frightening new habit and I do not know how to make it stop!<\/p>\n",

I was born in England (where the rest of my non-immediate family lives) but moved to the states when I was 2 years old. We started in Minnesota, then moved to Florida, then the bay area of California in the span of 5 years. I grew up in a little town called Pleasanton, California (as pleasant as it sounds) before moving to Houston, Texas where I spent 18 years going to Middle School (Kleb), High School (Klien) and getting my associates degree at a Community college (Tomball Community College). <\/p>\n<p>After working as a bartender for a bit and finishing out my degree, I got my first real job opportunity at Hewlett Packard as a data analyst in a QA lab. Went on to become a team lead of their Software Quality Assurance team for their diagnostics software a few months later. I felt lost in such a big company and didn't fit in with the culture at all.<\/p>\n<p>After a year and a half there I got an offer from a friend to come work at a WordPress Hosting company called WP Engine here in Austin. So I packed up my bags and got engrossed in the startup \"cult\"ure and really fell in love with the people and places of Austin. Other than the heat, it's a perfect place for me.<\/p>\n<p>My WordPress experience at the time was creating a site for my webcomic I had been working on. My dream as a kid was to become a cartoonist, and after getting back into it about 5 years ago, I've been getting really good at my doodles.<\/p>\n<p>I spent the last 3 years (before starting at Automattic) at WP Engine doing tech support for a huge range of customers.  Towards the end of my time there, the startup culture had faded (at least on the support team) and I started getting burnt out on coming into work each day to a much less happy\/exciting environment after they implemented a quota system that drove out all of my favorite coworkers. Eventually I left the company as well. Through it all though, I never took out my frustrations on my customers EVER and was still very proud of the quality of support I was able to give. After leaving, I was able to step back and get some really good perspective on how my personal skills were tailored for customer support and why I should keep pursuing it and it's why I decided to become a Happiness Engineer<\/p>\n<p>In my spare time, I go to an artist meet up twice a week to hone my doodling skills. You can find my stuff on Tumblr or (better yet) Twitter:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/moegeemoe.com\/<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/richardjohnhunt<\/p>\n<p>I also do a YouTube Channel with my best bud MadHatter McGinnis (who works here with Automattic and recruited me) and two of my old coworkers at WP Engine. We do a Let's Play (We lay video games and podcast over them) show called ScrubBudz where we play classic games. I do all the art and half of the video editing for it. We've accomplished a lot over the past year and even had a booth at SXSW Gaming that was right next to Nintendo's booth... crazy to think about. Our stuff is not totally \"kid friendly\" since we swear and stuff but it's pretty approachable even if you don't play video games:<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCJS67fg7Daj8GUWvpFpOUTg<\/p>\n<p>Other than that, I live out here by Zilker park (about 5 mins from downtown Austin) with my two Gerbils: Milk and Cranberries.<\/p>\n<p>I'll add more to this in the future :)<\/p>\n",

I grew up in a small town called Mazeikiai - the most notable fact about this town is the fact that a huge chunk of its population works at a nearby oil refinery.<\/p>\n<p>At the age of 15, I did my first attempts to do IT related work, like troubleshooting and fixing Windows issues, adding or replacing hardware etc. I was able to earn enough to go snowboarding once or twice a week during winter months. As it often happens at a young age, I didn't manage to keep up with growing competition and stay focused. Also I didn't quite enjoy the actual work.<\/p>\n<p>By the time I graduated from school, I had little idea what I want to do in life (besides snowboarding), so I went for Business Management and Administration degree in Klaipeda University.<\/p>\n<p>While studying, I tried a few jobs in completely different areas, but when the opening of a snowdome in Druskininkai, Lithuania, was announced in 2011 - I knew I had to be there.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after opening, in October 2011, I passed my exams and received an official certification of snowboarding instructor, which allowed me to work in our snowdome, as well as in Alps a few years later. Spending a lot of time strapped to a snowboard allowed me to become a local-level pro rider, and I did my fair share of competitions too.<\/p>\n<p>Few years later, I realized that being snowboarding instructor is a job for a few weeks or months a year only. I also realized there's more to life than just snowboarding, and I decided to pursue a career in IT.<\/p>\n<p>I didn't have any training in this area, and all my knowledge was self taught. I've spent a few months learning Java from Stanford online courses, as well as some Java for Android. <\/p>\n<p>After some time I started working at Western Union office in Vilnius as a Government Sanctions and Interdictions associate - even though this had little to do with IT. At the same time I was further deepening my IT knowledge - 3d modelling, indie game development, HTML and CSS. <\/p>\n<p>Later on, I worked as a Customer Success Manager at MailerLite - that allowed me to deepen my marketing knowledge, as well as get familiar with work in a successful IT company. <\/p>\n<p> SEO was also something I really enjoyed learning. I started experimenting with a WordPress membership site. Even though at some point I decided to give away my video tutorials for free - that experience helped me to get through a trial at Automattic, as a Happiness Engineer.<\/p>\n",

We also work with teens through our church, volunteer with Habitat for Humanity, and spend time having adventures with our daughter doing gymnastics, soccer, and lots of other stuff.<\/p>\n",

I've worked on many many different kinds of software products\/systems, mostly focused on empowering people and teams to do awesome things in enterprise contexts. I like the kinds of design problems that arise in around communication and collaboration. <\/p>\n<p>Non-work-related: <\/p>\n<p>One upon a time, I performed live Electronic\/IDM music around the US. I've DJ'ed in many major US cities. I still have a music studio set up that I don't use very much these days. These days I play live once or twice a year at small family-style music events in Northern California. <\/p>\n<p>My immediate family consists of my wife, two kiddos and I (kids are 4+8). We bought some land just under two years ago, and the four of us live in the Sierra Nevada foothills in California (about 3h from San Francisco). I spend a lot of time \u2014\u00a0when I'm not working \u2014 clearing brush, branches, and keeping up with fire prevention up here. I can see lots and lots of stars at night. <\/p>\n<p>I love water, and spend as much time as possible at rivers and lakes in the mountains in spring, summer and fall. Winter too if I can.<\/p>\n<p>I'm becoming an avid offroader, and slowly building up a vehicle capable of traversing difficult 4x4 trails here in the mountains. <\/p>\n<p>I'm a newbie woodworker and have been experimenting with home improvement projects: wood is unforgiving, and it is slow going, but rewarding.<\/p>\n<p>As of the last month, there is a beautiful dog sitting at my feet while I'm working. She's a 7-month old rescue, named Midnight Wednesday. We think she's Belgian Shepherd. I'm a noob dog parent, but so far so good. :D<\/p>\n",
